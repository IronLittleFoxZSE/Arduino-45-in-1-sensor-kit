This all-in-one sensor package supports a wide range of microcontrollers such as 
Arduino and Raspberry Pi. It contains a versatile assortment of 45 sensors and 
components that enable users to easily measure environmental variables. Notable 
modules included are an ultrasonic distance sensor, laser transmitter, dual 
temperature/humidity monitor, light-dependent resistor and more. 


Detailed project examples are provided for each sensor based on Arduino boards, 
including wiring diagrams and test code.With the help of these guided examples 
and tutorials, users can not only learn about each component but also create 
substantial interactive science and engineering projects. The kit provides everything 
needed to explore embedded systems development through hands-on experiences.

.. note:: Please note that Arduino and jumper wires are not included in the kit.
