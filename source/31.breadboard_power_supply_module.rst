Project31.Breadboard Power Supply Module
==========================================

Description
------------
The 3.3V/5V output MB102 Breadboard power supply module is an easy to use, most 
useful breadboard component that can be added with any breadboard related projects 
where 5V, 3.3V or both power requirements are required. Its ease of use allows users 
to connect any DC power supply unit that has 6.5-12 VDC power output from a barrel jack. 
The board has two independent channels of power output for breadboards. These power 
channels can be independently configured for 3.3V, 0V, and 5V operations.

The module also offers a push switch to turn OFF and ON the entire power supply module.

An additional feature is a USB input with two 5V, two 3.3V, and 4 GND pinout for 
additional power pin requirements.

The power LED will notify the user of input power availability status.
