Project28.Line Tracking Sensor Module
========================================

Description
------------
The KY-033 Line Tracking module is an infrared sensor that detects whether the 
surface in front of it is reflective or opaque. Sensitivity to ambient light can 
be adjusted using the knob to achieve a fairly accurate reading.

This sensor is typically used on wheeled robots and can operate at 3.3V to 5V 
which makes it compatible with a variety of microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32
, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, Teensy, and others.

Specification
--------------
- Working voltage	3.3V â€” 5.5V DC
- Output signal	TTL level (high level if line detected, low if no line detected)
- Board Size	1cm x 4.2cm

Connect
--------

Code
-----
.. code-block:: c

    int sensorPin = 7;  // line detection sensor interface
    int val;            // variable to store sensor reading

    void setup() {
    pinMode(sensorPin,INPUT);  // define sensor as input  
    Serial.begin(9600);     // initialize serial communication with PC
    }

    void loop() {
    val = digitalRead(sensorPin); // read value from sensor
    
    if (val == HIGH) { 
        Serial.println("Line detected"); 
    } else { 
        Serial.println("Line NOT detected"); 
    }

    delay(500);
    }

The signal will be HIGH when the module is in front of an opaque (black) surface, 
indicating that a line has been detected. The signal will be LOW when the module 
is in front of a reflective (white) surface, meaning that a line is not detected.
