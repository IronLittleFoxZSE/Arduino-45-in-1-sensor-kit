Project30.Relay
===================

Description
------------
The KY-019 consist of a 1MÎ© resistor, a LED, a 1N4007 rectifier diode and a 5VDC 
relay capable of handling up to 250VAC and 10A.

On the DC side of the board there are 3 male header pins for signal, power and 
ground. On the AC side there are 3 contacts, NC (Normally Closed),  Common and 
NO (Normally Open).


Specification
--------------
- TTL Control Signal	5VDC to 12VDC (some boards may work with 3.3)
- Maximum AC	10A 250VAC
- Maximum DC	10A 30VDC
- Contact Type	NC and NO
- Board Dimensions	27mm x 34mm

Code
-----
.. code-block:: c

    int Relay = 8;
    void setup()
    {
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);         //Set Pin13 as output
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);     //Set Pin13 High
    pinMode(Relay, OUTPUT);     //Set Pin3 as output
    }
    void loop()
    {
            digitalWrite(Relay, HIGH);   //Turn off relay
            delay(1000);
            digitalWrite(Relay, LOW);    //Turn on relay
            delay(1000);
    }

For this experiment, we use a laser emission module connected to a relay, but 
we could also use other LED modules.
